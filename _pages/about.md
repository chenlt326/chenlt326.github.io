I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of Washington (Department of Urban Design & Planning), working with Dr. Tzu-Hsin Karen Chen. My research integrates geospatial data science, remote sensing, and field measurements with urban climate and building-energy modeling to quantify how urbanization and surface modifications reshape heat exposure, energy demand, and health risks. At UW, I am advancing continental-scale analyses for a NASA-funded project on 3D urban change and humid-heat impacts across the Mediterranean. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at HKUST (<a href="https://walterzwang.github.io/" style="text-decoration: none;">Smart Building and Construction Lab</a>) and earned my Ph.D. in Civil and Environmental Engineering at HKUST (<a href="https://cejcyang.people.ust.hk/index.html" style="text-decoration: none;">Urban Climate Research Group</a>), following a B.Eng. from Sun Yat-sen University. My goal is to provied evidence-based insights to support the design of climate-resilient and low-carbon cities.

I am a Post-doctoral researcher in the Smart Building and Construction Lab, supervised by <a href="https://walterzwang.github.io/" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof. Zhe Wang</a>, in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST).

I completed my Ph.D. degree in 2023 from the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at HKUST, under the guidance of Prof. Jiachuan Yang (<a href="https://cejcyang.people.ust.hk/index.html" style="text-decoration: none;">Urban Climate Research Group</a>). Prior to that, I obtained my B.Eng. degree in 2019 with a major in Hydrology and Water Resources Engineering from the School of Geography and Planning, Sun Yat-Sen University.

To decarbonize cities, urban renewable technology is a potential solution. I am dedicating to developing a cross-scale urban climate-buildng energy simulation framework to assess the potential and impact of urban renewable technology (details can be found in the Research Page). Specifically, my work focuses on impact assessments of solar technologies such as photovoltaic panels and Building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) technology. With a diverse background in building systems, urban meteorology, and hydrology, my research interests revolve around the fascinating field of land-atmosphere interaction. I am particularly passionate about studying urban hydroclimate, urban heat island, green building and sustainable development. Additionally, I specialize in building energy simulation, contributing to the advancement of energy-efficient building design and assessing the building energy impact on the urban thermal environment.

Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in interdisciplinary research by combining principles from engineering, environmental science, and urban planning. I am dedicated to exploring innovative solutions that address the challenges of urbanization and climate change, with the ultimate goal of creating more sustainable and resilient cities.

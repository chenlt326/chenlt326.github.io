Intro:  Cities account for a large share of global energy use and emissions, yet urban-scale building energy modeling (UBEM) is still limited by data gaps and nonstandard geospatial workflows. Our GeoBEM framework bridges this gap by unifying GIS integration, automated data pipelines, and physics-based simulations to enable high-resolution energy modeling across cities. We are leveraging this platform to evaluate various building materials, retrofit strategies, and green finance applications, with multiple exciting studies underway - stay tuned for forthcoming findings!

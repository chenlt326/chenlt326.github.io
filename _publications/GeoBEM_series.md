Intro:  Cities drive global energy demand and emissions, yet urban-scale building energy modeling (UBEM) remains constrained by fragmented geospatial integration. Our GeoBEM framework bridges this gap by unifying GIS, automation, and physics-based simulations to enable high-resolution energy modeling across cities. We are currently leveraging this platform to test various building materials, retrofitting strategies, and green finance applications, with multiple exciting studies underway - stay tuned for forthcoming findings!

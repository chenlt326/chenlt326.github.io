Intro:
While large-scale photovoltaic (PV) roofs are key to sustainable cities, their impacts on urban heat islands (UHI) remains debated due to a lack of experimental validation. To resolve this, our team conducted a field experiment monitoring multiple 200 m² rooftop configurations in subtropical Hong Kong—comparing bare roofs, PV roofs, and PV-integrated green roofs (PVIGRs). This study provides the first real-world evidence of their thermal trade-offs. The work has been reported in PV Magazine (https://www.pv-magazine.com/2025/06/10/rooftop-pv-may-unintentionally-exacerbate-urban-heat/).

Key Findings:
- PV Heat Island Effect: PV roofs elevated local air temperatures by over 4 °C on sunny days, increasing top-floor monthly cooling demand by 1.5% during heatwaves and extending "Extreme Danger" heat exposure by 29.8% during power outages.

- PVIGR Mitigation: Though PVIGRs showed no cooling above panels, they reduced PV canopy temperatures by 1.26 °C in July, lowering PV surface temp and building cooling loads.

These insights highlight the need for climate-adaptive PV designs to balance energy generation and urban heat resilience.

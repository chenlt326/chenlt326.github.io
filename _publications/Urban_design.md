Intro: This paper develops a framework of parametric simulation for design guidance of urban streets.


Abstract:
Global warming and the urban heat island effect have led to the deterioration of the outdoor thermal environment and the rise of building cooling demand, calling for urban design with high environmental quality. However, little has been changed in the practice of urban street design. This paper bridges this gap by developing a framework of parametric simulation for design guidance of urban streets with an advanced urban canopy model that can simulate the interactive indoor-outdoor environment. Case studies are conducted at the neighborhood scale for six cities to improve outdoor thermal comfort and building energy efficiency in summer. The influence of street and building design parameters has been investigated based on 31104 simulations. Results reveal the conflict between optimizing outdoor thermal comfort and optimizing building energy efficiency. In the majority of the investigated cities, window-to-wall ratio, window type, and street orientation are the most influential parameters. Strategies by adjusting these parameters can significantly improve outdoor thermal comfort, as quantified by thermal stress hours, at a cost of increasing the building cooling load. Planting bigger and denser roadside trees always moderately reduces the thermal stress hours and building cooling load. These results demonstrate the potential of this framework to identify the design trade-offs between thermal comfort and building energy efficiency. The framework can be extended to various cities to help designers and policymakers at the early design stage.

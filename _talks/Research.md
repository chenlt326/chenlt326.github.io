Climate and energy systems are tightly coupled: rising temperatures increase cooling demand, and waste heat can intensify urban warming. My work integrates **field measurements**, **physics-based models**, **geospatial data science**, and **remote sensing** to quantify these feedbacks and to design **actionable mitigation strategies** at scales from buildings to entire cities.

## Field Experiment — Rooftop Mitigation Strategies
We conducted a full-scale experiment to explore different rooftop mitigation strategies. Below is a video introducing the experiment we conducted at HKUST, exploring different rooftop mitigation strategies.

## Modeling Frameworks
To analyze indoor–outdoor interactions, I couple a *building energy model* with a *single-layer urban canopy model (BEM–SLUCM)* and extend to *urban-scale building energy models (UBEM)* for scenario testing of PV strategies, retrofits, and materials.

## Remote Sensing & Geospatial Analysis — Heat Exposure & Equity
As part of a NASA-funded study on 3D urban change and humid-heat across the Mediterranean, I am building a geospatial analytics pipeline to quantify extreme heat exposure and equity.
Output: reproducible workflows and decision-ready indicators for climate adaptation and public health planning (Results will be posted here upon publication). 


<!--
<h2>Modelling Study</h2>
When city has large-scale implementation of vertical PV facade, their impacts on urban energy balance are unknown. To fill the research gap, a building-integrated photovoltaic parameterization scheme has been developed and incorporated into a building energy model coupled with a single-layer urban canopy model (BEM-SLUCM). This modelling framework facilitates a detailed analysis of indoor-outdoor interactions and assesses the impacts of PV and green strategies on urban climate.-->

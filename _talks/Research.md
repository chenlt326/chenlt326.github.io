Climate and energy systems are tightly coupled: rising temperatures increase cooling demand, and waste heat can intensify urban warming. My work integrates **field measurements**, **physics-based models**, **geospatial data science**, and **remote sensing** to quantify these feedbacks and to design **actionable mitigation strategies** at scales from buildings to entire cities.

## Field Experiment — Rooftop Mitigation Strategies
We conducted a full-scale experiment to test cool roofs, green options, and PV configurations. Below is a video introducing the experiment we conducted at HKUST, exploring different rooftop mitigation strategies.

## Modeling Frameworks
To analyze indoor–outdoor interactions, I couple a *building energy model* with a *single-layer urban canopy model (BEM–SLUCM)* and extend to *urban-scale building energy models (UBEM)* for scenario testing of PV strategies, retrofits, and materials.

## Remote Sensing & Geospatial Analysis — Heat Exposure & Equity
As part of a NASA-funded study on 3D urban change and humid-heat across the Mediterranean, I am building a geospatial analytics pipeline to quantify extreme heat exposure and equity.
Output: reproducible workflows and decision-ready indicators for climate adaptation and public health planning (Results will be posted here upon publication).

Research
Climate and energy systems are deeply interconnected, creating feedback loops that amplify challenges at both global and local scales. Rising temperatures drive increased cooling demand, whose waste heat further intensifies urban warming. Urban renewable technologies, such as PV, have great potential to improve energy efficiency and mitigate global warming.

My research primarily focuses on the performance and impact of various urban heat island mitigation strategies within the fields of urban climate and building energy, leveraging both experimental and simulation methodologies.

<h2>Modelling Study</h2>
When city has large-scale implementation of vertical PV facade, their impacts on urban energy balance are unknown. To fill the research gap, a building-integrated photovoltaic parameterization scheme has been developed and incorporated into a building energy model coupled with a single-layer urban canopy model (BEM-SLUCM). This modelling framework facilitates a detailed analysis of indoor-outdoor interactions and assesses the impacts of PV and green strategies on urban climate.-->
